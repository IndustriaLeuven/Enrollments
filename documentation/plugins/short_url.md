# Plugin: Short URL

The short URL plugin provides a way to create a shorter link to a form.

It is especially useful when using a printed enrollment link,
since the form can be referred to with a more easily typeable and rememberable URL without a huge UUID.

## Slug

The short URL that should direct to the form.
Because it is used to create an unique URL, its value is required to only occur once across all forms.
It may only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes (-).
