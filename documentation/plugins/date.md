# Plugin: Date

The date plugin limits the time the form is available to enter enrollments.

## Start date

If the current time is strictly before the start date, a visitor to the form will be presented with the message
that the form has not opened yet.

This value is not required. If it is left empty, the form will immediately be available to receive enrollments.

## End date

If the current time is strictly after the end date, a visitor to the form will be presented with the message
that the form has closed.

This value is not required. If it is left empty, the form will be able to receive enrollments forever.
