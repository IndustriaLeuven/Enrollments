# Plugin: Prefill user data

The prefill user data plugin automatically fills in name and email address of logged-in users.

If a form field with name `name` exists, the full name of the user is prefilled,
and the field gets disabled so the user cannot change it.

If a form field with name `email` exists, the primary email address of the user is prefilled,
but the field is left enabled so the user can change it, if desired.
